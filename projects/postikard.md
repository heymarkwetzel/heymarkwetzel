I share a love of travel with my friend, Jasna. She had gone on a series of trips abroad and noticed there was not an easy way for her to share her adventures directly with friends and family. She wanted a better way than to post to hundreds of "followers" on Instragram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

We had initially discussed a fully interactive journal experience with maps, lists, media, suggestions, search, recommendation, and a whole lot more. But, for MVP, we decided to focus on the idea of a custom, digital postcard.

## Discovery

I interviewed Jasna to gather requirements, establish scope, and zeroed in on how best to accomplish our goals. Our priorities were to keep it simple, quick, and personal.

### Keep it simple
We provide one custom filter, no choosing. The ‚ÄúGreetings from‚Äù copy can only be one of three fonts and four colors, simple to cycle through.

### Keep it quick
Especially if you‚Äôre out traveling, you want to spend as little time on your device as possible. The best moments of travel are making memories. Choosing or taking a photo is effortless and the messaging writing experience is familiar.

### Keep it personal
We prioritize sending the Postikard via text or email so that you are sharing your story with an individual. But, it‚Äôs also very easy to share to social media or save to your device to do whatever you‚Äôd like with it!

## Design

I went to the drawing board and gathered my notes into sketches and wireframes. The wires were delivered with an accompanying annotation document to maintain context and desired functionality.

We then partnered with an incredible Art Director and friend, [Dan Leu](https://www.danleu.me), to bring the concepts to life knowing that the look and feel would make or break the app.

The app is currently in development and we hope to launch soon. ü§û
