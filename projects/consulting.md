## Clients

I have been privileged to partner with a wide range of clients. Getting to know the ins-and-outs of such different businesses is one of my favorite parts of the job. It also allows me to view the world with a broader perspective and to quickly adapt to new business situations.

## Agencies

I started at my first agency in 2006 and was quickly surrounded by many talented people who helped give me invaluable experience. I was a FTE for seven years before jumping to a startup.

In 2015, I went out on my own as an independent contractor, partnering with agencies on larger projects. I split my time between agencies and startups while also helping to start a design studio with close friends.

My favorite part of working with larger teams is the droves of talented people who are within arms reach. They make it so easy to bounce ideas, quickly validate concepts, and to learn from different perspectives and set of experiences.
