## Design process
This process is simplified due to each project having its own specifications and needs. No project has been purely linear for me; instead they are a web of relationships that impact one another in complex ways.

However, most projects align to the following steps.

#### 1. Understand the problem
Discover, Define

#### 2. Design the experience
Design, Feedback, and Iteration

#### 3. Deliver a solution
Develop, Deploy
