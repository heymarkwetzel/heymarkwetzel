description: UX Lead. Full site redesign for a youth leadership camp in Michigan.

---

Van Buren Youth Camp (VBYC) hadn't had a website redesign since 2000. I worked with a small team to restructure, redesign, and deliver a new website that VBYC could manage on their own for years to come.

## Process

We interviewed members of the Board and established goals of increasing camper signup, the amount of returning campers, and to drive engagement with the dedicated alumni network. They talked a lot about the "spirit of camp" and recommended I visit while camp was in session... so I did! It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot about this truly special place.

With discovery tasks in my pocket, I returned to Chicago to conduct a full site audit which helped me established a new information architecture complete with page-level content recommendations. This process also led to a system of five Page Types (templates) that could be used as the site needs changed over time.

With the UX phase complete, I stayed on as consultant for design and development as new questions were uncovered through the final stages of the project.

## Results and Outcome
An alum from camp, upon seeing the site for the first time, cried tears of joy.
