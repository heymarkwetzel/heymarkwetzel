description: UX Lead. Designing Aero; software for Agents to manage flights and passenger information around the world.

---

United Airlines decided to move away from SHARES (a command-line interface) to Aero (GUI). SHARES was hampering their ability to hire younger talent because it is very difficult to learn. One KPI was to reduce the number of agents who would leave work in tears.

## Process
We spent a few days a week at Willis Tower talking directly to the Agents. Their knowledge and passion was invaluable; from gathering requirements to validating workflows, wireframes, and final designs.
Much of the work was very technical and rich with terms used by experts in the field (Deadhead, Ghost seat, PNR, SSMF, FLIFO, etc). We became proficient in both terminology and airline workflows in order to design best-in-class solutions. I led a team of three and partnered closely with both Design and Development.

## Results and Outcome
Aero was built to be "One application with many doors", accounting for all aspects of the customer's journey. We were able to successfully launch product updates for both Gate Agents and Customer Service Agents that are used today by 20,000+ agents around the world.
