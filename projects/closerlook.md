description: UX Lead. Module library, fully custom and editable.

---

`2016` closerlook had recently started their UX practice when I joined them as a freelancer. All projects for their largest client were developed with WEM (Web Experience Manager); a CMS with specific constraints. Design leadership was looking for a way to apply time-saving strategies to the UX phase and asked me to create a wireframe library.

### Project Goals
- Document all relevant modules and components
- Organize all modules and components into a easily usable Sketch library
- Decrease the amount of hours needed on a project for the UX team
- Provide efficiencies that allow Site Authoring to start sooner

---

## Team Overview

An internal project for closerlook, I teamed up with a Senior Designer/WEM Author early in the process for an orientation. I would then have periodic check-ins with the Director of the UX to receive feedback and modify priorities, if needed.

### My role
UX Lead

### My responsibilities
- Achieve a basic understanding of WEM; to navigate, not author
- Organize a schema that accounts for all components and modules
- Create a robust symbol library that includes said components and modules
- Document the library for future designers

---

## Design process
This process is simplified due to each project having its own specifications and needs. No project has been purely linear for me; instead they are a web of relationships that impact one another in complex ways.

However, most projects align to the following steps.

### 1. Understand the problem
*Discover, Define*

### 2. Design the experience
*Design, Feedback, and Iteration*

### 3. Deliver a solution
*Develop, Deploy*

## 1. Understand the problem
- WEM introduction
- Research

### WEM introduction
I sat with a WEM author and was given the tour of the system I would be feeding into. The CMS is complex, but it was quickly apparent that many structural elements (navigation, hero elements, etc) were re-used from client to client; this being the strategy and all. My colleague was able to give me the tools I needed to explore and the context I needed to get started.

### Research
Before I started designing, I looked into:
- how this instance of WEM was structured
- how other people structured libraries

#### WEM's structure
Many elements were already organized into a working IA. Instead of recreating an optimized structure (which would require many hours of approval and implementation), I leaned into what was there as my starting point. And so these became my parent items:
- Container
- Content
- Navigation
- Forms
- Templates

I then continued to audit all existing components from current and past project while cataloguing similarities, differences, and ways to combine them so I could design the "least common denominator" for future projects.

#### Other structures
[Atomic design](https://shop.bradfrost.com/) was so hot around this time, and it's still a great way to structure a design system. The most important piece is to think about a collection of components as a system, knowing that each piece should exist in harmony with the next.

As I built the document, I made sure to leverage those atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates to allow future updates to be easy to add.

### Result
I had already worked on a project or two that used WEM, so I knew how that cycle worked. Now being equipped with a larger knowledge of the tool itself, and some basic research that informed my IA and design strategies, I was ready to start designing.

## 2. Design the experience
- IA catalog
- Wireframe transcription

### IA catalog
In order to correctly audit all components from all projects for this client, I needed to be methodical.
I logged all components and their characteristics in a spreadsheet. I associated them with screenshots of existing elements and would de-dupe and combine similarities so as not to be redundant.

The IA catalog served as my "to do" list once I started wireframing and consisted of over 150 unique components for Desktop sizes. Mobile was also part of my delivery, so 300+ items came out of the initial list. As new client projects would come up, relevant modules would also be added mid-stream.

### Wireframe transcription
While marching through my IA catalog, I worked through the 300+ items until Desktop and Mobile components were created and organized as reusable, editable symbols in Sketch.

Since the symbol library is largely opaque in Sketch (along with the typography values), I created a static style guide to greet designers who hadn't used this system before. If they had trouble navigating the symbols tree structure, they could browse and copy what they needed.

In addition to the symbols, modules, and components, I was able to create full Templates that could be applied to a new project "as-is", used for discussion, or easily modified for a specific use-case.

## 3. Deliver a solution
- Executive approval
- Rollout

### Executive approval
Lorem ipsum

> “I feel like this is the Christmas morning I’ve been waiting for for five years.” - Ryan Mason, Chief Creative Officer. May 04, 2016. After Sandra (Director of UX Department) and I gave him our presentation of the Wireframe Tool in Sketch.

### Rollout
Use it on projects. Train WEM Authors and other designers on how it functions. Sketch was pretty new then, so Symbols were not widely known. No one is ever going to read this.
We even started to use the "Templates" level on some home pages.

### Result
Do I need this section?

## Final Result
I worked on more glamorous projects while at closerlook, but this one helped a real and present need. I created an efficient, reusable, and scalable tool for a large design agency. Used in conjunction with the process for this client, we were able to save time, money, and free up UX resources for more aspirational projects.

### Wins
- Successfully cataloged WEM components in use through 2016
- Decreased hours needed during the UX phase for WEM projects
- Established the first UX pattern library at closerlook
