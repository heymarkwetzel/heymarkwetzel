Haha Hot Dogs is my postcard and illustration side project. I've chosen, for some reason, to do all of my digital illustration in Sketch (yes, it can be painful). But the outcome has been 20+ postcards, 1 enamel pin, 2 koozies, several prints, and [plenty of stickers](https://www.stickergiant.com/blog/ha-ha-hot-dogs-stickers-show-their-humor-and-love-for-life/).
