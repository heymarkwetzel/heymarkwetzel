description: UX Lead. I pitched concepts, defined and managed requirements, led all design sprints and presentations, integrated feedback from client partners and users testing, and maintained desktop and mobile prototypes as we created a customer-facing retirement savings management portal.

Acme* (not their actual name) is a large company that helps people save for retirement. When a Customer talks to an Acme Financial Advisor, they have a much higher likelihood of engaging with their retirement. When they engage, they save more.

Our goal was to encourage customers to engage by creating and managing their own retirement plans.

The new software also needed to be:
- accessible to all levels of technical savvy
- understandable by people with little financial literacy

## Pitches

We outlined the business requirements in the initial meeting with Acme. From there, they asked us to brainstorm and present a handful of concepts. I put together a deck that included light competitive analysis. I presented 13 concepts and they chose two; Configure Your Future and Financial Health Meter. These would become our north star for the next few months.
