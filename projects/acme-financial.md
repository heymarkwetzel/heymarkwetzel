description: UX Lead. Creation of a customer-facing retirement savings management portal.

---

Acme (not their actual name) is a large company that helps people save for retirement. When a Customer talks to an Acme Financial Advisor, they have a much higher likelihood of engaging with their retirement. When they engage, they save more.

Our goal was to make it easier for customers to create and manage their retirement plans. The new software also needed to be:
1. accessible to all levels of technical proficiency
2. understandable by people without robust financial literacy

## Concepting

We outlined the business requirements in the initial meeting with Acme. From there, they asked us to brainstorm and present a handful of concepts. I put together a deck that included light competitive analysis as most people need visuals to understand the idea. I presented 13 concepts and they chose two; "Configure Your Future" and "Financial Health Meter". These would become our north star throughout the design process.

## Requirements and Content

With a topic as complex as personal retirement savings, requirements and precise content was key to success.
It was my responsibility to keep track of ever-evolving requirements and specific content decisions. Documenting and prioritizing this information informed navigation, page structures, what UI elements to consider, and more.

When dealing with the complexities involved in calculating retirement preparedness, it is important to be as accurate as possible - especially in the early phases. I made sure to use real data and content whenever possible.

## Wireframes as Requirements

Acme was a very visual client and best made decisions regarding requirements by digesting wireframes and prototypes. I took the lead on sketching, creating visual concepts and prototypes for both Desktop and Mobile.

This was a lean project and we used our weekly design meetings to validate requirements, uncover new features, adjust priorities, and tackle technical feasibility. We had an agenda each week to stay focused, as the product had many moving parts.
The end result was a concise, organized, and highly-detailed retirement savings portal that will help more people be prepared for their retirement years.
