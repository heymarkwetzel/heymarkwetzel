description: UX Lead. Creation of a customer-facing retirement savings management portal.

---

Acme (not their actual name) is a large company that helps people save for retirement. When a Customer talks to an Acme Financial Advisor, they have a much higher likelihood of engaging with their retirement. When they engage, they save more.

Our goal was to make it easier for customers to create and manage their retirement plans.

The new software also needed to be:
- accessible to all levels of technical proficiency
- understandable by people without robust financial literacy

## Concepting

We outlined the business requirements in the initial meeting with Acme. From there, they asked us to brainstorm and present a handful of concepts. I put together a deck that included light competitive analysis as most people need visuals to understand the idea. I presented 13 concepts and they chose two; "Configure Your Future" and "Financial Health Meter". These would become our north star throughout the design process.

## Requirements and Content

With a topic as complex as personal retirement savings, requirements and precise content was key to success.
It was my responsibility to keep track of ever-evolving requirements and specific content decisions. Documenting and prioritizing this information informed navigation, page structures, what UI elements to consider, and more.

## Wireframes as Requirements

Acme was a very visual client and best made decisions regarding requirements through visuals - wires and prototypes.


I took the lead on sketching, creating visual concepts and prototypes for both Desktop and Mobile. This was a lean project and used our design meetings to catalog a list of business requirements and user requirements. Every decision was steeped in real data and actual use-cases. When dealing with retirement calculations over 30+ years, it is important to be as accurate as possible. (I like to use real data and content whenever possible as it helps the designs be more precise.)
