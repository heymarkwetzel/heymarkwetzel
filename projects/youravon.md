description: UX Lead. Redesign of the Representatives' business portal.

## Summary

Avon is a social-selling beauty company - one of the first of its kind. They face more competition in this space than ever before.

We worked with them to fully update and redesign the suite of tools used by their business owners with the goals of
- Consolidating and updating the current toolset
- Enticing the younger generation to join by providing a modern and user-friendly experience

## Process

I led several tracks of work while collaborating closely with the Avon design team and our client partners. I helped to plan sprints, define requirements, iterate on designs and prototypes, consult with developers and QA before releases, and more.

Each set of features started with intensive requirements gathering, informed by interviews with Representatives and complemented by competitor analysis to ensure we were properly directing our designs.

Our successes were many; from including images with products for the first time to restructuring the site's IA. Below are a few highlighted features that I personally oversaw.

### Registration and Sign In

Avon started before computers were mainstream and so many of the internal processes have holdovers from paper-centric management systems. My work on Registration and Sign In flows provided new functionality such as:
- Using an email for Registration and Sign In
- Using Facebook or Gmail for Registration and Sign In
- Solving for new account recovery scenarios
- Solving for duplicate emails and account splitting
- Fewer steps and streamlined registration experience
- many more Avon-specific use cases

## RepFest 2018

We had a great relationship with our Avon partners. They treated us like family and I had the honor of attending RepFest 2018 in Columbus, OH.

We spoke to hundreds of Representatives, demoed our product updates live on iPads in personal, one-on-one conversations, and were there to hear thousands cheer in the convention center when the CEO showed them screen shots of our work on the big screen.
