description: UX Lead. Redesign of the portal used by Representatives to manage their business.

## Summary

Avon is a social-selling beauty company - one of the first of its kind. They face more competition in this space than ever before.
We worked with them to fully update and redesign the suite of tools used by their business owners.
#### Primary goals
- Consolidating separate sites and tools into one
- Updating the design and experience to be more modern and user-friendly

## Process

I led several tracks of work while collaborating closely with the Avon design team and third-party vendors. I helped to plan sprints, define requirements, iterate on designs and prototypes, consult and QA with developers, and more.
Each set of features started with intensive requirements gathering, informed by user interviews and complemented by competitive analysis to help inform our design strategy.

Our successes were many; from including images with products for the first time to developing a custom library of helpful actions a business owner can take.
Below are a few features that I oversaw personally.

### Registration and Sign In

Avon started before computers were mainstream and so many of the internal processes have holdovers from paper-centric management systems. My work on Registration and Sign In flows provided new functionality such as:
- Using an email for Registration and Sign In
- Using Facebook or Gmail for Registration and Sign In
- Solving for new account recovery scenarios
- Solving for duplicate emails and account splitting
- Fewer steps and streamlined registration experience
- many more Avon-specific use cases

### Next Best Action
Running a business is difficult. If you're new to it, it can be downright overwhelming. We created a system of recommendations to suggest clear and direct actions that could be taken immediately to benefit their business.

### Enter Items
The more experienced Representatives have been selling Avon for decades. By updating their portal, we were interrupting their workflows. We worked especially close with them on the Enter Items feature which allows quick entry of Product Numbers for customers orders. From physical spreadsheet, to digital table, to a single row that populates a list, we successfully added robust features while staying true to the way seasoned Representatives are comfortable getting work done.

## RepFest 2018

We had a great relationship with our Avon partners. They treated us like family and invited us to attend RepFest 2018 in Columbus, OH.

Together, we spoke to hundreds of Representatives, demoed our product updates live on iPads in personal, one-on-one conversations, and were there to hear thousands cheer in the convention center when the CEO showed them our work on the big screen.
