description: UX Lead. Designing Aero; software for Agents to manage flights and passenger information around the world.

---

`2013` United Airlines decided to move away from SHARES (a command-line interface) to Aero (GUI). SHARES was hampering their ability to hire, and keep, talent because it is very difficult to learn. We literally were working under a "No More Tears" initiative; less agents calling in sick or leaving work crying.

### Project Goals
- Create a fully functioning GUI that utilizes the back end functionality of SHARES
- Consolidate all Agent tools under one banner - Aero
- Design to meet the needs of all airport environments, including Agents without mice, low light scenarios, black and white monitors, and more.
- Zero down time. The application must be functional and easy to learn.

## Team Overview

Airport and Contact Center agents partnered directly with the Critical Mass team and created a collaborative relationship that allowed us to help shape the user experience of the AERO application with the actual end users providing invaluable insight.

We had the unique benefit of getting to collaborate tightly with our actual users - Gate Agents and Contact Center Agents. My role was to recommend flows and patterns that maintain best practices and create experiences that are intuitive while decreasing the Agentsâ€™ average handle time (AHT).

## Design process
This process is simplified due to each project having its own specifications and needs. No project has been purely linear for me; instead they are a web of relationships that impact one another in complex ways.

However, most projects align to the following steps.

### 1. Understand the problem
*Discover, Define*

### 2. Design the experience
*Design, Feedback, and Iteration*

### 3. Deliver a solution
*Develop, Deploy*

United Airlines decided to move away from SHARES (a command-line interface) to Aero (GUI). SHARES was hampering their ability to hire younger talent because it is very difficult to learn. One KPI was to reduce the number of agents who would leave work in tears.

## Process
We spent a few days a week at Willis Tower talking directly to the Agents. Their knowledge and passion was invaluable; from gathering requirements to validating workflows, wireframes, and final designs.
Much of the work was very technical and rich with terms used by experts in the field (Deadhead, Ghost seat, PNR, SSMF, FLIFO, etc). We became proficient in both terminology and airline workflows in order to design best-in-class solutions. I led a team of three and partnered closely with both Design and Development.

## Results and Outcome
Aero was built to be "One application with many doors", accounting for all aspects of the customer's journey. We were able to successfully launch product updates for both Gate Agents and Customer Service Agents that are used today by 20,000+ agents around the world.
