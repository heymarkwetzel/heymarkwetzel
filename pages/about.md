Hey, I'm Mark.

I got into user experience design because I wanted to make things better for people.
I help my clients reach their goals while removing barriers for their customers and user-base. I've been fortunate enough to work closely with many passionate people to help identify their needs, improve processes, and redesign UIs that all help to improve their day-to-day.

I've worked across many different industries, for companies big and small, and have found the language of design can be applied to any problem.

I am currently doing freelance UX work remotely and I am based out of New York's beautiful Hudson Valley.

In my spare time, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/621952-mark) non-fiction, getting into nature, and working on my passion projects of [Haha Hot Dogs](https://www.instagram.com/hahahotdogs/) and [Postikard](https://www.postikard.com).
