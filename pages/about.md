Hi, I'm Phil. I'm a user experience designer with an obsession for making things simpler. During my career, I've had some of the world's largest companies as clients, I've started a couple design agencies, and I've been a design executive at a startup. I'm currently doing freelance UX work remotely and for companies in my home city of Chicago.

In my spare time, I like being outside in nature, taking photos non-stop, and drawing on any piece of paper you put in front of me.
