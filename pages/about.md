Hey, I'm Mark. ðŸ‘‹

I make the internet easier to use so that real life becomes a happier place to be.
I love working with fun, smart people to problem solve and build things that are loved. If we're going to spend the time, might as well make it worth our while!

The design process is something that I use every day in work or life. Problem identification, critical thinking, confidence, humility, adjustments. It's helpful when designing an app, playing poker with your pals, building a camp fire, et al!

I live in New York's beautiful Hudson Valley; home to so many hikes, apple trees, and the [world's best hot dogs](https://peteshotdogsinc.com/). Before this, I spent the previous 15 years having a great time in Chicago.

When I'm not UX'ing things, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/621952-mark), getting into nature, playing music, and working on my side projects of [Haha Hot Dogs](https://www.instagram.com/hahahotdogs/) and [Postikard](https://www.postikard.com).
